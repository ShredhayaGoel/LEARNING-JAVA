# 🖥️ Learning Java 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This is where I practice and document my journey of learning **Core Java, DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms), and Java Swing**.

## 📌 What’s Inside?
- ✅ **Java DSA Questions** – practicing problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and GFG  
- ✅ **Core Java Concepts** – OOPs, Collections, Multithreading, File Handling, etc.
